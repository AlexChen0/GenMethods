# Welcome to my website!
This website is constructed for CS396 Gen Methods at Northwestern. 

## What's in here:

← `README.md`: Gives basic description of the site and inspiration.

← `index.html`: Main web page describing what needs to be rendered on-screen

← `style.css`: Styling for aspects of the HTML page being rendered

← `script.js`: Adds a button for now, will be more complex later


## Instructions

go to https://somber-grape-dryosaurus.glitch.me/ and check out the website itself! Alternatively, check out the preview button in the toolbar at the bottom of the page. 

## Thank yous

I'd like to thank StackOverflow and CSS Zen Garden for helping tons with the construction of the site, and geeksforgeeks for giving me really fast zero-bullshit html help.
